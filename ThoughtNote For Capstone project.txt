## HTML ,CSS and Js Structure :

In this project, I have extensively used HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and interactive clothing ecommerce website. Here's a breakdown of the HTML and CSS structure:

### HTML Structure

1. **Home.html**: This is the main HTML file that serves as the homepage of the website. It contains the overall structure of the page, including the header, navigation menu, featured products section, and footer.

2. **product.html**: This HTML file is responsible for displaying the individual product pages. It includes details such as the product name, price, description, and related images.

3. **cart.html**: This file handles the shopping cart functionality. It displays the selected items, allows users to update quantities, and proceed to checkout.

4. **contact.html**: This HTML file manages the contact Info. It includes a form for users to enter Email and message for our company.

5.**Login.html** : This Html file contain one form in which user has to fill there emails and password for login in marley's fashion.

### CSS Styling

For the styling of the website, I have utilized CSS to create a visually appealing and cohesive design across all pages. I have use Internal Css in this project.For styling my webpages.

### Javascript 

I also use javascript in login page and cart page for showing successfull message after putting email and password and showing order place message by using function and showing alert message for it.
